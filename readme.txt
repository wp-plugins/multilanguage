This plugin allows you to create content on a Wordpress site in different languages.

== Description ==

Multilanguage allows you to create a multilingual WordPress website. Hence, you can create or edit posts, pages, or create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them. The translation of a post, whether it was created in the default language or not, is optional. All translations must be done manually using Multilanguage plugin, because it does not integrate any automatic or professional translation service.

NOTE: This plugin will only work with the themes and plugins, which were developed according to Wordpress Codex standards. Also, it uses standard filters (the_title, the_content, get_terms, get_the_terms, get_term, wp_get_nav_menu_items).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Multilanguage translate my content? =

No, it will not. It manages relationships between sites and translations, but it doesn't change the content.

= Will Multilanguage translate the content automatically? =

No, it will not. All translations must be done manually.

= Can I add more than 76 ​​pre-installed languages? =

Yes, you can add any number of languages to the list of pre-installed languages in file "include/languages.php".

= How can I change content display language? =

You can change content display language through the widget, which is activated automatically when you activate the plugin if you have an active sidebar. If you have several active sidebars, the widget is added to the sidebar, which features a search widget. But if you do not have an active sidebar, you need to create it and add Multilanguage widget manually.

= When changing content display language, will WordPress localization in the frontend be changed as well?  =

In the plugin settings, you can enable/disable an option to switch Wordpress localization when the language is changed in the frontend. If you enable this option, you must install additional language packs for Wordpress to have this function working. However, in the backend, Wordpress localization corresponds to the default language, and cannot be changed.

= Where can I get additional Wordpress language packs? =

You can find all official translation files in WordPress [language repository](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/).

= Can I use Multilanguage on a single-site? =

Yes, you can use Multilanguage in a single-site without any problems.

= Can I use Multilanguage on a multi-site? =

Yes, you can use Multilanguage on a multi-site without any problems as well. The plugin settings on each site will be unique.

= When I try to update the post after editing, changes are not saved if I have not filled the title and content fields. Why? =

When Title and Content fields in active language tab are empty, if you try to update the post after editing, the changes will not be saved and an error message will appear. You need to fill at least one field or switch to another language tab, on which the fields are filled, and try to update again.
